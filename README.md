# Neptune OS
## What is Neptune OS
Neptune OS is a 64bit UEFI Unix-like OSdev Hobby Project, Unlike [Photon](https://github.com/rayanmargham/Photon) it is actively developed with code that doesn't make your eyeballs scream in pain.

## Fresh Beginnings
Neptune OS will allow me to continue my osdev journey I had given up on for a year, I'm hoping that by the end of the year we will have something really exciting to show. I can't wait to see how this turns out.
